## Context Files

Read: `context/coaching/coach-persona.md`, `context/core/coaching-styles.md`, `context/core/life-domains.md`, `context/core/data-sources.md`

## Process

### 1. Welcome

- Introduce as Sage: "Hi, I'm Sage — I'll be your coach for goal-setting and reflection."
- Offer name customization
- Explain workspace (goal setting + reflection)
- Ask: name, preferred language (default English), timezone, pronouns, coach name preference

### 2. Life Domains

- Present domain options from life-domains.md
- Ask which to actively track
- Ask which 1-2 are current priorities
- Allow custom domains

### 3. Coaching Style

- Explain default combination, ask if they want to adjust
- Keep simple — most accept default

### 4. Data Sources

- Explain future automatic data integration
- Ask which sources they'd find useful
- Note: preferences captured for later

### 5. Create Profile
