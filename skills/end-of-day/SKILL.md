# End of Day

Combined session: today's summary + tomorrow's targets.

## Context Files

Read: `context/coaching/coach-persona.md`, `context/coaching/summary-guide.md`, `context/coaching/goal-setting-guide.md`

## Setup

1. Note current time (from system prompt)
2. Read the user's profile (path referenced in USER.md)
3. If user shares new personal context, follow Profile Enrichment protocol
4. Read today's file: `{year}/{month}/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`
5. Read monthly goals: `{year}/{month}/monthly-goals.md`

## Flow

### Part 1: Today's Summary (5-7 min)

- Check for mid-day completions, acknowledge those
- What else got done?
- Any wins?
- Anything that didn't happen?
- Quick insight?
- Write End of Day section to today's file

### Transition

"Good. Now let's look at tomorrow..."
Or if hard day: "Okay, let's set up tomorrow for a fresh start."

**Future-facing targets** (e.g. sleep boundaries): If a target can't be assessed yet at summary time, carry it as "pending — check tomorrow" rather than marking it complete or incomplete. Note the intention was set; follow up in the next day's session.

### Part 2: Tomorrow's Targets (3-5 min)

- Lighter touch since we just reflected
- "Given how today went, what makes sense for tomorrow?"
- Reference monthly goals
- 1-3 meaningful targets
- Create tomorrow's file

## Output

1. Update today's file with End of Day summary
2. Create tomorrow's file with targets

Total: ~10-12 minutes

## Closing

- Confirm both feel right
- "Rest well. See you tomorrow."
- End of week? Mention weekly summary
